# What is C++?

- C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
- The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
- It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
- C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.

# Why C++?

- C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on.
- C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.
- C++ is a portable language. This means that C++ programs once written can be run on different platforms without any or minimal changes.
- C++ provides a rich library that contains built-in functions. This makes programming easier and reduces the coding length.
